! This section contains the list of third-party advertising networks domains.
! Note, that we only put rules that block full domains here and not URL parts (there's `general_url.txt` for that). Also, it must be domains that are used in a third-party context.
! The rules with hints are at the end of file.

! Good: ||doubleclick.net^$third-party
! Bad: /banner.jpg (should be in general_url.txt)
! Bad: ||adssubdomain.legitwebsite.com^ (should be in adservers_firstparty.txt)
